### Assignment 8th
#### Expense Tracker in TypeScript

An Expense Tracker is a simple application that allows users to log, categorize, and view their expenses. It's a great TypeScript project because it involves working with types, state management, and local storage.

Features:

Add new expenses (amount, category, date, description).

Categorize expenses (Food, Travel, Bills, Shopping, etc.).

View expense history.

Store data in local storage so it persists after refreshing the page.

Filter expenses by category or date range.
